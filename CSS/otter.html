    <h1>OTTERS ARE SO CUTE</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Otters are carnivorous <a href="nowhere">mammals</a> in the subfamily Lutrinae. The 13 extant otter species are
        all semiaquatic,
        aquatic or marine, with diets based on fish and invertebrates. Lutrinae is a branch of the Mustelidae family,
        which also includes weasels, badgers, mink, and wolverines, among other animals.</p>
    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>The word otter derives from the Old English word otor or oter. This, and cognate words in other Indo-European
        languages, ultimately stem from the Proto-Indo-European language root *wódr̥, which also gave rise to the
        English word "water".</p>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        An otter's den is called a holt or couch. Male otters are called dogs or boars, females are called bitches or
        sows, and their offspring are called pups. The collective nouns for otters are bevy, family, lodge, romp
        (being descriptive of their often playful nature) or, when in water, raft.

        The feces of otters are typically identified by their distinctive aroma, the smell of which has been described
        as ranging from freshly mown hay to putrefied fish; these are known as spraints.
